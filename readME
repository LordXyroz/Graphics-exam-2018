=== GFX EXAM Maarten Dijkstra *11.05.18 -> 14.05.18* ===


### Extra Features ###
- FOG
Fog is toggle with the 'RETURN' key

- High-res maps
There is a bool at line 20 in main.cpp that you can use to toggle loading of high-res maps.
At line 63 in Functions.cpp, you can change the map to what you want to use, as long as the .png file is located in /resources/heightmaps.
For smaller maps, you can change the name at line 30.

NOTICE:
Do not add the file ending/type as parameter of these functions. The name is automatically appended with .png within the function.



## Build and run ##

Build instructions used are assimilated from the lab instructions for this course.

Windows (cmake-gui)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Set the source code file to the root directory containing "CMakeLists.txt"
2. Binaries can be built in the directory of your choice, e.g.~"OpenGL\build\"
3. Click the configure button and select which generator you would like to use
4. Click the generate button
5. If your generator is an IDE such as Visual Studio, then open up the newly created .sln file and build "ALL_BUILD". After this you might want to set "main" as you StartUp Project.

Linux (Ubuntu)
  # Create build subdirectory in directory and navigate into it

  # Generate UNIX Makefile (point CMake to CMakeLists.txt)
  cmake ..

  # Execute make command
  make

  # Run executable
  ./bin/main

* '-'		- Toggle between freeCam and follow Glider



### Camera modes ###

freeCam - free movement of the camera from input (not fully implemented).
staticCam - camera has static position
followCam - camera follows target (game object) in a distance equals followDistance
trackingCam - camera stays stationary but tracks target (game object)
orbitTargetCam - camera orbits target (game object) in a distance equals followDistance
orbitPositionCam - camera orbits a static position

### Credit ###
The framework was made with the collaboration of Maarten Dijkstra, Eirik Hiis Hauge, Haakon Aarstein, Sindre Blomberg, Nataniel Gåsøy, Herman Tandberg Dybing and Christian Bråthen Tverberg.
